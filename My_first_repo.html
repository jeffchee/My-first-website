    <h2> About Me</h2>

        <p>     My name is Jeffrey Chee. I graduated from UC Irvine with a bachelors in International Studies. During my times at UCI,
            I joined Alpha Phi Omega, a community service fraternity, where I held a couple of leadership positions. As Corresponding 
            Secretary, I connect other APO fraternities with collaborative services and hangouts.
            <br>
            I worked at Golden Harvest as a sales rep for 3 years. Currently I am back at school learning about Coding and Web development.
